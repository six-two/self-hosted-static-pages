    <h1>Binaries</h1>
    Binaries are not inculded in the git repository, since they are really huge (SysInternals alone is 273MB for all variants currently).
    If you want them, run the <code>update-encoded-binaries.sh</code> script, that will download and convert them.
    <br>
    If you did that, the links below should work.
    The <code>(HTML)</code> links are for the files wrapped with self-unzip.html, which may help with restricitve web proxys since the proxy will not see a the EXE file download:
    <ul>
        <li><a href="sysinternals.html">Microsoft SysInternals</a></li>
    </ul>
</body>
