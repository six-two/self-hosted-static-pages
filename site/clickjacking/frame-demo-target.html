    This page should likely be framable (you should see this text), unless you set specific headers on your server to prohibit it.
    
    Try other sites like:
    
    <ul>
        <li>https://example.com (frameable)</li>
        <li>https://google.com (not frameable)</li>
        <li>https://duckduckgo.com (not frameable)</li>
        <li>https://neverssl.com (frameable)</li>
        <li>https://six-two.dev (frameable)</li>
        <li>Your own web site(s)</li>
    </ul>

    By design entirely static web sites or web sites without any login functionality/user sessions are usually not really vulnerable to clickjacking attacks, unless there are more complicated measures like IP address based access control in use.
    The reason is, that the attacker could just send the desired requests directly to the server.<br>

    Tests should be performed as an logged in user, since only they are useful targets for clickjacking attacks.
    Actually go through workflows that seem exploitable, because sometimes they may involve a redirect to a third party server that has clickjacking protections and will ruin your attack.
